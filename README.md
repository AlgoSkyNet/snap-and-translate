## Architecture

## Flow
1. User interacts with the mobile app and captures an image or selects an image from the photo album.
2. The image is passed to the Node.js server application which is running on IBM Cloud Kubernetes service that uses Tesseract OCR to recognize text in images and Watson Language Translator will translate the recognized text.
3. Result is returned to the mobile app for display.

## Included components
* [IBM Cloud Container Service](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html): IBM Bluemix Container Service manages highly available apps inside Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters on the IBM Cloud.
* [Watson Language Translator](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/language-translator/): IBM Watson Language Translator is a service that enables you to dynamically translate news,patents or conversational documents.

## Featured technologies
* [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/): An an open-source mobile development framework to build hybrid mobile apps.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): An open-source JavaScript run-time environment for executing server-side JavaScript code.
* [Tesseract OCR](https://nodejs.org/): An open-source Optical Character Recognition(OCR) engine.
